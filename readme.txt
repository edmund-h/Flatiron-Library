FLATIRON LIBRARY
by Edmund Holderbaum


This is an app to access the flatiron library database!

Please use this app to let us know when you have borrowed a book. Here’s how to use it:

Upon opening, you will be presented with a list of all books in the library by title.

Note that the library is displayed alphabetically, and displays the author as well. 

From this list, select the book you want to check out to be taken to the detail view.

You’ll see the title, author, publisher displayed here. 

If the book has been checked out before that info will also be displayed.

When you’re ready to check out, hit the checkout button and write your name and the date.

The info will update to reflect your checkout.

There is also a “Delete” button in the detail view. 

We’re trusting you to use this only to clean up any old, spurious, or misspelled references. 

Pressing the delete button will take you back to the list of books by title.

You’ll also notice an “add” button at the top right of the list.

From here you can add a new book with title, author, and publisher.

In order to submit, you need all three filled in or else they will flash red.

Once all fields are filled, you can submit the new book to be added to the library.

We’re trusting you not to put in anything offensive or misspelled, so be careful!

There is also a dice button below the add book button.

When clicked, this will populate all fields with a random book on programming.

Thanks and have fun!
